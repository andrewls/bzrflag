# An incredibly simple agent.  All we do is find the closest enemy tank, drive
# towards it, and shoot.  Note that if friendly fire is allowed, you will very
# often kill your own tanks with this code.

# NOTE TO STUDENTS
# This is a starting point for you.  You will need to greatly
# modify this code if you want to do anything useful.  But this
# should help you to know how to interact with BZRC in order to
# get the information you need.
#
# After starting the bzrflag server, this is one way to start
# this code:
# python agent0.py [hostname] [port]
#
# Often this translates to something like the following (with the
# port name being printed out by the bzrflag server):
# python agent0.py localhost 49857
