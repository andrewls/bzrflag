GENERAL
- add a LICENSE file and add copyright headers to each python file
- add unit tests
- move bzrflag/bzrflags/docs to bzrflags/docs;
  remove bzrflag/bzrflag/make.bat or put it in a non-code directory
- move the test directory from bzrflag/bzrflag/test to bzrflag/test
- consider adding setuptools for installability

CODING STYLE
- add doc strings and other documentation
+ make naming and whitespace styles more compliant (PEP 8) and consistent,
  with whitespace between operators, max line length of 80, etc.(23 June 2011)
+ remove local dead (commented-out) code(23 June 2011)
+ remove global dead code: snapshot.py etc.(23 June 2011)
- figure out why there are different classes with the same name in
  graphics.py and modpygame.py: either document or merge--there seems to be
  some half-implemented plan for implementing other graphics library (would
  this even work? why not just put all of the graphics code in one place?)
- straighten out the licensing for collide.py; integrate it into the code
  base more fully
- move any and all magic constants to constants.py
- unify SeppiTank and GoodrichTank into a single class; if there are two
  different classes, they should be named after motion (StandardTank and
  HoverTank) not people
+ remove any * imports (all imports should be explicit)(23 June 2011)

NEW FEATURES
- add a command line option to enable cheats and restore the hammertime and
  fireatwill commands from the git history

BUGS
- fix the GUI bug that causes tanks and bases to jitter when dragging the
  map (from a fully zoomed out perspective)




- agents*.pyc in compiled bots folder have bad magic number error
